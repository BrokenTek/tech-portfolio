I am a software developer with a passion for problem solving. I have experience with multiple languages and enjoy 
creating projects that combine multiple frameworks to bring together robust desktop and web applications. I have
a Computer Programming & Development AAS degree that was very enjoyable to earn as the contents of the program
were concepts that interested me greatly.

Some Things About Me
1. I am a manager at a Chipotle Mexican Grill located in Durham, NC.
2. I am involved in the handling of front-end updates to a few church websites.
3. I value hard work, a modular approach to problem solving and commitment.
4. I have received a certificate for C++ Programming.
